# Writing Your Docs

Holocron provides two ways to write your documentation: using a visual editor or writing in Markdown (MDX). Both options offer unique advantages, allowing you to choose the approach that best suits your needs.

## Visual Editor

Holocron's visual editor is built on top of Tiptap, a powerful rich-text editor. It offers a user-friendly interface with features similar to popular tools like Notion. With the visual editor, you can easily create and format your content without worrying about Markdown syntax.

### Features

- **WYSIWYG Editing**: The visual editor provides a "What You See Is What You Get" editing experience, making it easy to visualize how your content will appear.
- **Formatting Options**: You can apply various formatting options such as bold, italic, headings, lists, tables, and more with just a few clicks.
- **Drag and Drop**: The editor supports drag and drop functionality, allowing you to rearrange sections or add media effortlessly.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple users can simultaneously work on the same document, making collaboration seamless and efficient.

## Markdown (MDX)

If you prefer having full control over your documentation's code and formatting, you can choose to write in Markdown (MDX). Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for documentation and other text-based content.

### Advantages of Markdown

- **Simplicity**: Markdown syntax is easy to learn and use. It allows you to focus on writing content without distractions.
- **Version Control**: Markdown files are plain text files, making them ideal for version control systems like Git. You can easily track changes, collaborate with others, and roll back to previous versions if needed.
- **Extensibility**: With MDX (Markdown with JSX), you can embed React components directly into your Markdown files, allowing you to add interactivity and dynamic content to your documentation.

### Syntax Examples

#### Titles

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

#### Lists

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
```

#### Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}

greet('Holocron')
```

These are just a few examples of Markdown syntax. You can explore more advanced features and syntax options in the Markdown documentation.

Whichever method you choose, Holocron empowers you to create beautiful and well-structured documentation effortlessly. Happy writing!
